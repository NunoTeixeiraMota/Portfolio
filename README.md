## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experience, serving as an online resume and portfolio.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

### Vite

Vite is used as the development server and bundler for this project. It provides a fast development environment with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and lightning-fast builds.

### React

React is the core library used for building the user interface components of this project. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces efficiently.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is used to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase. It helps catch errors early during development and provides better tooling support for code navigation and refactoring.

### Cobux

Cobux is integrated into the project for code formatting and linting. It ensures consistent code style across the codebase and helps maintain code quality standards.

### Vercel Deploy

Vercel is used for deploying the website. It offers seamless deployment workflows, automatic CI/CD, and scalability for static sites. Deployments are triggered automatically upon pushing changes to the `main` branch, ensuring a smooth development and deployment process.

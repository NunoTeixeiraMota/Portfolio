## 💻 Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

### Vite 🌀

Vite is used as the development server and bundler for this project. It provides a lightning-fast development environment with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and rapid builds. ⚡

### React ⚛️

React is the core library used for building the user interface components of this project. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces efficiently. 🔧

### TypeScript 🔷

TypeScript is used to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase. It helps catch errors early during development and provides better tooling support for code navigation and refactoring. 🛠️

### Cobux 🧹

Cobux is integrated into the project for code formatting and linting. It ensures consistent code style across the codebase and helps maintain code quality standards. 📝

### Vercel Deploy ☁️

Vercel is used for deploying the website. It offers seamless deployment workflows, automatic CI/CD, and scalability for static sites. Deployments are triggered automatically upon pushing changes to the `main` branch, ensuring a smooth development and deployment process. 🚀
